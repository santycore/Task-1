## LED Matrix Cube confrolled by FPGA
    A 10x10x10 led cube matrix, (or a 8x8x8 for the ease of construction) can be made and can be controlled by FPGA, which is programmed
    in machine code, this code can be modified to give output every single moment of our choice. This LED can be continuously patterned 
    to give continuous wave-like patterns

## 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit
    8-bit ALU is a mini computer with far less processing power, only capable of doing basic Arithmetic operations one at a time. This 
    Project can either be done with FPGA's or with the aid of simple AND, OR, NOR, NAND, NOR GATES and Shift registers. This is also the
    basic to learn Computer logic.

## Quadruple legged arduino bot
    This bot can manuver through rough terrains, slopes, harsh conditions, the 4 leg mechanism allow movement along all 4 directions, and
    also allows the body to rotate about its center. it is controlled by 12 servo motors, 3 for each leg, giving it high movement access 
    and helps in manuverability.

## Automatic paper cutter with Machine Learning on Raspberry-Pi
    Auto matic paper cutter uses Machine learning models, and cuts through the outline printed on the paper with precision, it is 
    controlled by 3 stepper motors, two control the position, one control the angle of the blade. This can be useful to people doing 
    paper craft projects, and pepakura.

## Game-Server on Raspberry-Pi
    Raspberry-Pi is a microcomputer with a Mobile ARM Architecture CPU and also come with upto 8 GB RAM, this can be used to host 
    servers for some AAA, indie games like Minecraft, Assault Cube, Terraria, This can come in handy, as a 8 GB Ram server can come
    upwards of 800 Rs per month. The same cost for a year comes upto the price of installation of the Raspberry-Pi server.Maintenance is 
    minimum in case of Raspberry-Pi servers.
